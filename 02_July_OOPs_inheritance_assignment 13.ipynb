    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class. The existing class is often referred to as the \"base class\" or \"parent class,\" while the new class is called the \"derived class\" or \"child class.\" This mechanism promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship among classes.\n",
    "Inheritance is useful when you want to create new classes that share attributes and behaviors with existing classes. It should be used when there's a clear \"is-a\" relationship between the new class and the existing class."

    "Single inheritance refers to the concept where a class can inherit attributes and methods from only one parent class. In other words, a derived class can have only one immediate base class.\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance simplifies class hierarchies, making them easier to understand and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Diamond Problem: Single inheritance inherently avoids the \"diamond problem,\" a complication that can arise in multiple inheritance due to ambiguous method resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearer Code: Since there's only one parent class, it's clear where the attributes and methods of the derived class are coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. This means a derived class can have more than one immediate base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reuse: Multiple inheritance enables a derived class to inherit features from multiple sources, facilitating greater code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Richer Functionality: You can combine traits from different parent classes to create a more comprehensive and specialized derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling Complex Relationships: Multiple inheritance is useful when modeling real-world situations involving multiple characteristics or behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixins: Multiple inheritance can be used to create mixins—small, reusable components that add specific behaviors to classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences\n",
    "Ambiguity: Multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguity if the same method is defined in multiple parent classes. This can result in conflicts during method resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiple inheritance can introduce complex class hierarchies, potentially making code harder to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond Problem: In multiple inheritance, the diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor. This can lead to confusion in method resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Resolution Order (MRO): Both single and multiple inheritance have a defined order in which the methods of parent classes are resolved in the derived class. In Python, the C3 Linearization algorithm is used to determine the MRO."
